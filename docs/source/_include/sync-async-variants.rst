.. note::

   This page uses two different syntax variants:

   * Synchronous code with classic :code:`def` functions, usable in any context.

   * Asynchronous code with :code:`async def` functions, using an asynchronous framework to perform I/O operations.

     All examples assume that you are using :py:mod:`asyncio` as an asynchronous operation framework.

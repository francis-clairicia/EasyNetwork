.. note::

   This page uses two different API variants:

   * Synchronous API with classic :code:`def` functions, usable in any context.

   * Asynchronous API with :code:`async def` functions, using an asynchronous framework to perform I/O operations.

     All examples assume that you are using :py:mod:`asyncio`.

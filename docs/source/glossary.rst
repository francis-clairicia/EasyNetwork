   communication protocol
      A set of formal rules describing how to transmit or exchange data, especially across a network.

      In EasyNetwork, it is up to the developer to define his communication protocol using a :term:`protocol object`.

   composite converter
      A :term:`converter` that processes different objects in input and output.

      .. seealso:: :class:`.StapledPacketConverter` class.

   converter
      An interface responsible for bridging the gap between the Python objects manipulated by the application/software
      and the :term:`data transfer objects <data transfer object>` handled by the :term:`serializer`.

      It must also ensure that deserialized objects are valid and usable by the application/software without post-processing.

   data transfer object
      An object that carry data between processes in order to reduce the number of methods calls. It is a flat data structure
      that contain no business logic.

      In EasyNetwork, the DTOs are manipulated by the :term:`serializer` and transformed into business objects by a :term:`converter`.

   DTO
      See :term:`data transfer object`.

   incremental serializer
      See :term:`serializer`.

   one-shot serializer
      See :term:`serializer`.

   packet
      A unit of data routed between an origin and a destination on a network.

   protocol object
      An object representing a :term:`communication protocol`. It consists of a :term:`serializer` and, optionally, a :term:`converter`.

   serializer
      The lowest layer for passing from a Python object ( a :term:`DTO` ) to raw data (:class:`bytes`) and vice versa.

      It must have no knowledge of the object's validity with regard to the application/software logic,
      nor the meaning of data with regard to the :term:`communication protocol`.
      This ensures a generic format that can be reused in any project.

      For example, the :class:`.JSONSerializer` only knows how to translate dictionaries, lists, strings, numbers and special constants,
      and how to reinterpret them.

      A serializer imposes its own limits on the objects it can translate and on the validity of the object itself
      (for example, as a JSON object, a dictionary must only have character strings as keys).

      Ideally, a serializer should only handle :ref:`primitive types <bltin-types>` and :ref:`constants <built-in-consts>`.

      There are 2 types of serializers:

      * one-shot serializers

        One-shot serializers provide the full representation of a Python object in :class:`bytes` **in a single function call**,
        and need this same full representation to recreate the object **at once**.

      * incremental serializers

        Incremental serializers, on the other hand, provide the full representation of the Python object in :class:`bytes` **part by part**,
        sometimes including additional metadata used during deserialization.

        During deserialization, they have the ability **to know when the** :term:`packet` **is complete** (and wait if incomplete)
        and which bytes are not part of the initial :term:`packet`.

   serializer wrapper
      A :term:`serializer` that transforms data coming from another :term:`serializer`.

      Example:

      >>> from easynetwork.serializers import JSONSerializer
      >>> from easynetwork.serializers.wrapper import Base64EncoderSerializer
      >>> s = Base64EncoderSerializer(JSONSerializer())
      >>> data = s.serialize({"data": 42})
      >>> data
      b'eyJkYXRhIjo0Mn0='
      >>> s.deserialize(data)
      {'data': 42}

      Most of the time, a serializer wrapper is an :term:`incremental serializer` in order to allow a :term:`one-shot serializer`
      to be used in a stream context.
